### Definition

Discards the least recently used items first. This algorithm requires keeping track of **what was used when**, which is expensive if one wants to make sure the algorithm always discards the least recently used item. 

### Usage

A Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache **organizes items in order of use,** allowing you to quickly identify which item hasn't been used for the longest amount of time.

### Implementation



#### Queue



#### Hash
